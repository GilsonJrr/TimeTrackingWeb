### What I learned

With this challenge, I learned how to use a more responsive design using reactjs and styled-components,  I tried to create a design as close as possible to the example given on the frontendmentor website.

### Continued development

The next step would be to add a button in which the user could add the time daily, also a login, and possible more activities
